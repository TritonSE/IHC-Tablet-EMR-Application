Situations:
1. When retrieving any single info (i.e. Patient, Triage, etc), then grab the
most recent version
  - When reading info:
    - Read the lastUpdated field of the returned object:
      - The info local to the tablet might have a lastUpdated timestamp larger
        than the server if there was a previous error sending the update to the
        server
          - In this case:
            1. send an update right away
            2. don't do anything, and hope the user will eventually update
            3. Display a notice to the user that they should send an update when
               ready (PROBABLY DO THIS OPTION)

      - The info local to the tablet will have a smaller lastUpdated timestamp
        than the server if another tablet sent an update
          - In this case, save the newer version to the local database
      - Could run into problems if multiple people work on same form at once,
        because after one sends updates, then the other wont be able to send
        updates. Emphasize to volunteers to only work on one per person,
        implement synchronization locks if possible.

2. When creating/updating info:
  - update the lastUpdated field of both that info AND the encompassing patient
    (i.e. when updating Triage, update both the Triage's lastUpdated field, AND
    the corresponding patient's lastUpdated field), both server and mobile sides

3. At the end:
  1. upload updates
    Ultimately need to sync the server with info from this local tablet
    - Mobile side: Grab all patients marked with needToUpload: true, send to server
      - needToUpload will only be true if a prior Create/Update was unsuccessful
      - If Create/Update was successful, then the server already has the updated
        version
    - Server side: Iterate through patients and each of their forms:
      - If incoming.lastUpdated > existing.lastUpdated, then replace existing with
        incoming

  Must upload updates from all tablets before downloading in order to be in sync

  2. download updates
    1 Each tablet keeps track of when it was last synced
    2. Grab all patients who have been updated since the tablet was last synced
    3. Iterate and compare one by one with mobile side and update each patient/form
       if the server-side version was updated more recently
